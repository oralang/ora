# Formal Verification for Complex Conditions

> **⚠️ Development Status**: The formal verification framework exists but most proof strategies currently return placeholder results. This is under active development.

Ora's formal verification system provides advanced mathematical proof capabilities for complex logical conditions, quantifiers, and sophisticated mathematical reasoning. This extends beyond basic static analysis to handle complex mathematical proofs and logical constructs.

## Overview

The formal verification system includes:

- **Multiple Proof Strategies**: Direct proof, proof by contradiction, mathematical induction, case analysis, symbolic execution, bounded model checking, and abstract interpretation
- **Quantifier Support**: Universal (∀) and existential (∃) quantifiers with domain constraints
- **Mathematical Theory Database**: Built-in axioms and support for custom lemmas
- **Symbolic Execution**: Path exploration for complex control flow
- **SMT Solver Integration**: Support for Z3, CVC4, Yices, and other theorem provers
- **Proof Caching**: Automatic caching of successful proofs for performance

## Key Components

### 1. Formal Condition Structure

```zig
pub const FormalCondition = struct {
    expression: *ast.ExprNode,
    domain: MathDomain,
    quantifiers: []Quantifier,
    axioms: []Axiom,
    proof_strategy: ProofStrategy,
    complexity_bound: u32,
    timeout_ms: u32,
};
```

### 2. Mathematical Domains

The system supports verification across different mathematical domains:

- **Integer**: Integer arithmetic and comparisons
- **Real**: Real number arithmetic
- **BitVector**: Bit-level operations
- **Array**: Array operations and indexing
- **Set**: Set theory operations
- **Function**: Function composition and properties
- **Algebraic**: Algebraic structures and operations

### 3. Proof Strategies

#### Direct Proof
- Uses logical rules and axioms to prove conditions directly
- Best for simple mathematical statements
- High confidence when successful

#### Proof by Contradiction
- Assumes the negation and derives a contradiction
- Useful for existence proofs and negative statements
- Requires careful handling of assumptions

#### Mathematical Induction
- Proves statements over natural numbers or ordered structures
- Base case and inductive step verification
- Ideal for recursive properties and quantified statements

#### Case Analysis
- Breaks complex conditions into simpler cases
- Proves each case individually
- Effective for disjunctive conditions

#### Symbolic Execution
- Explores all possible execution paths
- Tracks symbolic values and constraints
- Excellent for program correctness verification

#### Bounded Model Checking
- Verifies properties up to a bounded depth
- Faster than full verification but less complete
- Good for finding counterexamples

#### Abstract Interpretation
- Over-approximates program behavior
- Sacrifices precision for efficiency
- Useful for large-scale verification

## Usage Examples

### Basic Mathematical Condition

```ora
// Simple arithmetic verification
function test_arithmetic(x: u256) -> u256
    requires x > 0
    ensures result > x
{
    return x + 1;
}
```

### Quantified Conditions

```ora
// Universal quantification
function array_sum(arr: u256[]) -> u256
    requires forall i: u256 where i < arr.length => arr[i] > 0
    ensures result > 0
{
    // Implementation
}

// Existential quantification
function has_even(arr: u256[]) -> bool
    ensures result == true => exists i: u256 where i < arr.length && arr[i] % 2 == 0
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### Complex Mathematical Properties

```ora
// Prime number verification
function is_prime(n: u256) -> bool
    requires n >= 2
    ensures result == true => forall d: u256 where d > 1 && d < n => n % d != 0
    ensures result == false => exists d: u256 where d > 1 && d < n && n % d == 0
{
    // Implementation with formal proof
}

// Greatest common divisor
function gcd(a: u256, b: u256) -> u256
    requires a > 0 && b > 0
    ensures result > 0
    ensures a % result == 0 && b % result == 0
    ensures forall d: u256 where d > 0 && a % d == 0 && b % d == 0 => d <= result
{
    // Implementation with mathematical proof
}
```

### Loop Invariants

```ora
function fibonacci(n: u256) -> u256
    requires n >= 0 && n < 100
    ensures result >= 0
    ensures n <= 1 || result == fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
{
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    
    let prev1 = fibonacci(n - 1);
    let prev2 = fibonacci(n - 2);
    
    invariant prev1 >= 0 && prev2 >= 0;
    invariant prev1 + prev2 >= prev1 && prev1 + prev2 >= prev2;
    
    return prev1 + prev2;
}
```

  Complexity: 0.50

Condition 2: ✗ UNPROVEN (counterexample found)

Condition 3: ✓ PROVEN (confidence: 98.0%)
  Strategy: SymbolicExecution
  Time: 2500ms
  Complexity: 2.30

Summary: 2/3 conditions proven (66.7%)

```

## Performance Considerations

### Complexity Management

The formal verification system includes several mechanisms to manage complexity:

1. **Complexity Bounds**: Configurable limits on proof complexity
2. **Timeout Controls**: Automatic timeout for long-running proofs
3. **Proof Caching**: Reuse of previously computed proofs
4. **Parallel Verification**: Multiple conditions verified simultaneously
5. **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Automatic selection of appropriate proof methods

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic conditions before adding complexity
2. **Use Appropriate Domains**: Choose the right mathematical domain for your conditions
3. **Leverage Quantifiers Carefully**: Quantified conditions are more complex to verify
4. **Provide Good Invariants**: Strong loop invariants help verification
5. **Cache Proofs**: Enable proof caching for repeated verification
6. **Monitor Performance**: Use verification reports to optimize proof strategies
