Zig handles integer division explicitly and safely, giving the developer full control over rounding and remainders. Hereâ€™s how Zig does it, and what we can learn for Ora:

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ 1. No Implicit Rounding Up or Down

In Zig:

const result = a / b;

This performs truncating division (rounds toward zero), just like EVM integer division.

For example:

13 / 5 == 2
-13 / 5 == -2

ðŸ”¸ 2. Access to the Remainder

Zig lets you explicitly get the remainder using %:

const quotient = a / b;
const remainder = a % b;

This is equivalent to:

const (q, r) = divmod(a, b); // in pseudocode

So developers can always track rounding loss.

ðŸ”¸ 3. Checked Division for Safety

Zig offers safe, checked operations:

const result = try std.math.divTrunc(u32, a, b);

	â€¢	If b == 0, this errors at runtime.
	â€¢	You must try or catch it.
	â€¢	Encourages explicit handling of divide-by-zero cases.

ðŸ”¸ 4. Rounding Modes

Zig provides different division functions for various rounding behaviors:

Function	Behavior
divTrunc(a, b)	Truncate toward zero
divFloor(a, b)	Round toward âˆ’âˆž
divCeil(a, b)	Round toward +âˆž
divExact(a, b)	Division that errors if a % b != 0
divMod(a, b)	Returns both quotient and remainder

This gives precision and avoids surprises.

ðŸ”¸ 5. No Silent Loss

Zig avoids silent behavior. If thereâ€™s loss of precision, overflow, or undefined behavior, you get:
	â€¢	Compile-time error (for some constants)
	â€¢	Runtime error (when using try)
	â€¢	Or forced explicit handling (catch, orelse, etc.)

âœ… For Ora: Takeaways

We can adopt a Zig-inspired integer division model:
	â€¢	âœ… Provide divmod(a, b) as default low-level primitive
	â€¢	âœ… Require try if division can fail (e.g., div-by-zero)
	â€¢	âœ… Consider adding divFloor, divCeil, divExact
	â€¢	âœ… Division (/) could just be an alias for divTrunc for now
	â€¢	âœ… Always allow access to the remainder via % or tuple unpacking

Would you like to sketch out the Ora standard library functions for this (e.g. divmod, divExact, etc.)?
