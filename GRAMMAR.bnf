Of course. I have performed a careful revision of the grammar, applying the fixes we discussed and improving clarity and consistency while keeping the core "explicit and secure" philosophy intact.

The result is a more robust and less ambiguous grammar that will be easier to implement in a parser and more intuitive for developers.

### Summary of Key Changes:

1.  **Unified Variable Declarations:** The conflicting `const_declaration` and `variable_declaration` rules have been merged into a single, unambiguous `variable_declaration` rule. The parser's job is now simpler, and semantic checks (e.g., ensuring `const` is initialized) are correctly deferred to the analysis phase.
2.  **Strict L-value Assignments:** The left-hand side of assignments (`=`, `+=`, etc.) is now restricted to a new `lvalue` rule, which only permits assignable expressions (like variables or field/index accesses). This prevents syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code like `(a + b) = 5;`.
3.  **Clearer `move` Statement:** As requested, the `move` statement now uses a more descriptive `move ... from ... to ...` syntax, enhancing readability and intent for financial operations.
4.  **Standard Logical Operators:** The logical operators have been changed from `&` and `|` to the industry-standard `&&` and `||`. The single `&`, `|`, and `^` are now correctly defined as bitwise operators with the appropriate precedence. This drastically reduces the potential for developer error.
5.  **Consistent Array Syntax:** The array type syntax has been clarified to better distinguish between fixed-size and dynamic-size arrays, following a more Zig-like convention (`[N]T`).
6.  **Removed Optional Semicolons:** The optional semicolons in `requires` and `ensures` clauses have been removed to enforce a single, consistent coding style.

Here is the complete, revised grammar.
