# Design Documents

Design notes and architectural rationale for the Ora
language and compiler. These documents are meant to be read as research
artifacts: they record intent, trade-offs, and open questions.

## How to read them

- Treat them as **design intent**, not a guarantee of implementation.
- Cross-check with the implementation baseline in `TYPE_SYSTEM_STATE.md`.
- Use them to understand why a decision exists, not just what it is.

## Current documents

- [Type System (v0.1)](./design-documents/type-system-v0.1)

## Contributing

When adding a design document, keep the structure explicit:

- Context and problem statement
- Proposed design and rationale
- Alternatives considered
- Implementation implications
- Status (proposed, in progress, superseded)
