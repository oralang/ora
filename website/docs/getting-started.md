# Getting Started

Set up the Ora development environment and try the current implementation.

> **ðŸš§ EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT**: Ora is NOT ready for production use. This guide is for experimenting with the current implementation and understanding the development progress.

## Prerequisites

- **Zig 0.14.1** or later
- **CMake** (for Solidity library integration)
- **Git** (for submodules)
- **Basic familiarity with smart contracts** (helpful but not required)

## Installation

### Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oralang/Ora.git
cd Ora

# Initialize submodules (required for Solidity integration)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the compiler
zig build

# Run tests to verify installation
zig build test
```

### Verify Installation

Test that Ora is working correctly:

```bash
# Check the compiler help
./zig-out/bin/ora --help

# Run a simple compilation test
./zig-out/bin/ora examples/core/simple_parser_test.ora
```

## Current Implementation Status

### What Works Now
- âœ… Basic contract compilation
- âœ… Yul code generation
- âœ… EVM bytecode output
- âœ… Simple storage operations
- âœ… Function definitions and calls

### What's In Development
- ðŸš§ Formal verification system
- ðŸš§ Advanced error handling
- ðŸš§ Memory safety guarantees
- ðŸš§ Standard library functions

## Try Your First Contract

Let's explore the current implementation with a simple storage contract.

### Create a Test Contract

Create a file `simple_test.ora`:

```ora
contract SimpleStorage {
    storage var value: u256;
    
    pub fn set(new_value: u256) {
        value = new_value;
    }
    
    pub fn get() -> u256 {
        return value;
    }
}
```

### Compile the Contract

```bash
# Compile to Yul (intermediate representation)
./zig-out/bin/ora simple_test.ora

# The compiler will output Yul code that can be further compiled to EVM bytecode
```

## Exploring Examples

The repository contains working examples that demonstrate current capabilities:

### Core Examples
- `examples/core/simple_parser_test.ora` - Basic parsing demonstration
- `examples/core/control_flow_test.ora` - Control flow structures
- `examples/tokens/simple_token.ora` - Token contract patterns

### Advanced Examples (Experimental)
- `examples/advanced/formal_verification_test.ora` - Formal verification syntax (in development)
- `examples/advanced/error_union_demo.ora` - Error handling patterns (in development)

### Run Example Tests

```bash
# Test core functionality
./scripts/test-examples-simple.sh

# Run all example tests (some may fail - this is expected)
./scripts/test-examples.sh
```

## Understanding the Output

When you compile an Ora contract, you'll see:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Token stream from source code
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Abstract syntax tree (AST) 
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Type checking and validation
4. **HIR Generation**: High-level intermediate representation
5. **Yul Output**: Ethereum's intermediate language
6. **Bytecode**: Final EVM bytecode (if successful)

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with existing examples** - Understand current capabilities
2. **Make small modifications** - Test incremental changes
3. **Expect compilation errors** - Many features are still being implemented
4. **Report interesting findings** - Help improve the language

### Common Issues

- **Syntax errors**: Language syntax is still evolving
- **Compilation failures**: Some features are not yet implemented
- **Runtime errors**: Limited testing of generated bytecode
- **Missing features**: Advanced functionality is in development

## Next Steps

### If You Want to Explore Further

1. **Study the examples** - See [`examples/`](./examples) for working code patterns
2. **Read the specifications** - Check [`docs/specifications/`](./specifications/) for technical details
3. **Try modifications** - Experiment with syntax variations
4. **Review the source** - Understand the compiler implementation

### If You Want to Contribute

1. **Report bugs** - File issues for unexpected behavior
2. **Suggest improvements** - Discuss language design decisions
3. **Submit examples** - Share interesting contract patterns
4. **Help with documentation** - Improve this notebook

## Development Environment Tips

### IDE Setup
- Use any text editor with basic syntax highlighting
- Zig language server provides some support for the compiler code
- No dedicated Ora language support yet

### Debugging
- Use `zig build test` to run compiler tests
- Check `zig-out/bin/ora --help` for compiler options
- Review generated Yul code for understanding compilation process

### Building from Source
```bash
# Clean build
zig build clean
zig build

# Debug build with more information
zig build -Doptimize=Debug

# Release build for performance
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Limitations and Warnings

### Current Limitations
- No standard library yet
- Limited error messages
- Incomplete type system
- No formal verification implementation
- Minimal testing framework

### Safety Warnings
- **Do not use for production contracts**
- **Generated bytecode is experimental**
- **Language syntax will change**
- **No security audits performed**
- **API is unstable**
